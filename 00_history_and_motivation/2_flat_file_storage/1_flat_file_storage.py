🧠 THEORY: Why We Need DBMS

Before databases, applications used **flat files** like `.txt` or `.csv` to store data.
This method works for small, simple tasks but fails when data grows or multiple users need access.

Problems with flat files:
- ❌ No concurrency handling
- ❌ Hard to enforce structure or constraints
- ❌ Inefficient for querying large datasets
- ❌ Difficult to handle transactions or recovery

This script simulates a primitive file-based data storage system.
It will help us appreciate what a DBMS solves.
