# 📘 MongoDB vs SQL: Use Case Guide

This document provides an overview of when to use **MongoDB (NoSQL)** versus **SQL (Relational databases)** based on system requirements and structure.

---

## 🔍 When to Use MongoDB (NoSQL)

MongoDB is ideal for systems that benefit from flexible schemas, high write throughput, and nested or semi-structured data.

### ✅ Ideal Use Cases

🧠 **1. Content Management Systems (CMS)**  
Why MongoDB? Content like blog posts, comments, tags, and metadata can vary in structure. MongoDB’s flexible schema handles this better than rigid SQL tables.  
Example: WordPress alternatives, headless CMS (like Strapi or KeystoneJS)

🛍️ **2. E-commerce Catalogs**  
Why MongoDB? Products may have different attributes (e.g., shirts vs. laptops). MongoDB allows each document to store only relevant fields.  
Example: Shopify-like systems with dynamic product types and filters

📱 **3. Mobile or Social Apps**  
Why MongoDB? Fast prototyping, frequent schema changes, and hierarchical user data (posts, likes, messages) are better suited for document databases.  
Example: Instagram-like apps, chat apps, or location-based services

🌐 **4. IoT and Sensor Data Platforms**  
Why MongoDB? It can ingest large volumes of time-series data from different devices with different formats, and offers high write throughput.  
Example: Smart home device logging, industrial sensor monitoring

📊 **5. Real-time Analytics Dashboards**  
Why MongoDB? Ingests and aggregates large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data quickly. Supports fast updates and queries.  
Example: Clickstream analytics, real-time user behavior tracking

🧾 **6. Event Logging and Monitoring Systems**  
Why MongoDB? Logs vary in structure across sources. Mongo’s flexible documents and high write performance fit log storage well.  
Example: Application log aggregators, security log dashboards

🎮 **7. Gaming Platforms**  
Why MongoDB? Player profiles, achievements, and in-game assets can be modeled naturally as nested documents that vary by game.  
Example: MMORPG user state storage, leaderboard and matchmaking data

💬 **8. Chat and Messaging Apps**  
Why MongoDB? Conversations are naturally nested (users → chats → messages). MongoDB’s structure allows easy retrieval and sharding.  
Example: WhatsApp clones, customer support chat platforms

🔍 **9. Search Engines / Metadata Indexing**  
Why MongoDB? Schema-less documents allow fast indexing of diverse metadata structures.  
Example: Document repositories, internal search platforms for enterprise files

🧬 **10. Bioinformatics and Scientific Research Tools**  
Why MongoDB? Research data varies widely in structure, especially in genomics or lab experiments.  
Example: Genomic databases, experimental trial storage

## 🧱 When to Use SQL (Relational Databases)

SQL databases are preferred when data consistency, integrity, and complex relationships are essential.

### ✅ Ideal Use Cases

🏦 **1. Financial Systems / Banking**  
Why SQL? Requires strong ACID compliance, complex transactions, and strict data integrity.  
Example: Core banking systems, ledger accounting, payment processing platforms

🧾 **2. Invoicing and Billing Systems**  
Why SQL? Precise relationships between customers, services, prices, taxes, and invoices are best modeled with relational tables.  
Example: Utility billing platforms, telecom billing systems

🎓 **3. University or School Management Systems**  
Why SQL? Relationships between students, courses, grades, schedules, and professors require normalized data and joins.  
Example: SIS (Student Information System), academic records systems

🚚 **4. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**  
Why SQL? These systems involve inventory, orders, employees, and finance — all needing structured and relational data models.  
Example: SAP-like platforms for managing operations

👩‍⚖️ **5. Government and Legal Records**  
Why SQL? Requires strict audit trails, formal schema, and reliable reporting. Long-term consistency is critical.  
Example: Civil registries, case tracking systems

🏥 **6. Hospital and Medical Records (EMR/EHR)**  
Why SQL? Medical data often needs to comply with standards (e.g., HL7, HIPAA) and be traceable and auditable.  
Example: Electronic Health Record (EHR) platforms, prescription databases

🛒 **7. Online Transactions / Order Systems**  
Why SQL? Shopping carts, stock updates, and order processing depend on atomic transactions and referential integrity.  
Example: Amazon-style checkout and fulfillment systems

🧾 **8. CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**  
Why SQL? Structured relationships between leads, contacts, companies, and interactions benefit from normalized tables and reports.  
Example: Salesforce-like platforms, support ticket systems

📈 **9. Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools**  
Why SQL? SQL databases integrate well with BI tools and offer consistent structured schemas for deep analytics.  
Example: Dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, Looker

🧠 **10. Human Resources and Payroll Systems**  
Why SQL? Employee records, pay history, tax deductions, benefits — all require consistency and relational modeling.  
Example: Payroll processors, performance tracking systems
