### ObjectId Fields

ObjectId is MongoDB's default primary key type for the `_id` field. It is a 12-byte hexadecimal identifier generated automatically when documents are inserted.

📝 In raw MongoDB, ObjectIds are stored as BSON native types. When exported to JSON, they appear using "$oid" for clarity.

🧱 **Example Fields**:

- `_id`: An ObjectId generated by MongoDB.
- `username`: A string field used for identification.

📌 **Use Cases**:

- Primary keys for documents.
- Referencing between collections (e.g., userId, postId).
- Efficient storage of unique identifiers.

✅ **Advantages**:

- Encodes timestamp, machine ID, process ID, and counter.
- Globally unique and efficient to generate without coordination.
- Supports time-based sorting by insertion order.

🚫 **Limitations**:

- Not human-readable like custom string IDs.
- Timestamps are not user-friendly and must be decoded.
- Use with caution in sharded clusters to avoid predictability issues.
