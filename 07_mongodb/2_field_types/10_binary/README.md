### Binary Fields

Binary fields store arbitrary binary data such as files, encrypted content, or compressed blobs. They use BSON's native binary type.

ðŸ“„ This example encodes binary file content in base64. MongoDB stores it using the BSON Binary type with an optional subtype.

ðŸ§± **Example Fields**:

- `_id`: A string identifier.
- `filename`: A string name of the uploaded file.
- `data`: A base64-encoded binary buffer with a subtype.

ðŸ“Œ **Use Cases**:

- Storing images, PDFs, audio files, or videos directly in the database.
- Handling encrypted values, hash results, or binary payloads.
- Representing compact formats such as Protocol Buffers.

âœ… **Advantages**:

- Efficient for handling non-textual or compressed data.
- Can be processed securely in binary form.
- Subtypes allow for organization of binary content (e.g., UUID, encrypted).

ðŸš« **Limitations**:

- Base64-encoded data is bulky when exported to JSON.
- Not ideal for large files (GridFS is better for streaming large content).
- Retrieval and display require decoding logic on the client side.
