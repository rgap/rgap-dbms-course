### Regular Expression Fields

Regular expression fields allow pattern matching within string data using BSON’s `RegExp` type or the `$regex` operator.

✏️ This pattern matches typical email addresses. When used in MongoDB queries, $regex can be paired with options like $options: 'i' for case-insensitivity.

🧱 **Example Fields**:

- `_id`: A string identifier.
- `description`: A short label for the regex.
- `expression`: A regular expression pattern for validation or searching.

📌 **Use Cases**:

- Searching strings by pattern (e.g., email, phone format).
- Validating field content during queries.
- Building configurable search filters.

✅ **Advantages**:

- Flexible and powerful pattern matching.
- Useful for validating user input or filtering text dynamically.
- Can be indexed with specific patterns using text indexes.

🚫 **Limitations**:

- Not optimized for large-scale performance unless used with care.
- Queries using `$regex` may bypass indexes without anchors.
- Must escape characters properly to avoid malformed patterns.
